# 00004 - Do it in bash

## Abstract

Bash is universal and quite easy to use. To make it a practise exercise I converted the zig code to a single bash script.

## Context and Problem Statement

I need some practise on easy and short exercises to train my skills in writing tools for daily use. This litte project was ideal scope to port to another language. Especially after I have seen Brad Cyperts [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXWvWhfWrUU](Youtube Video)

## Considered Options

- Rewrite in Python
- Rewrite in C++


## Decision Outcome

Write it in bash

### Python

I already do some python, so I have other areas of practise.

### C++

I learnd Rust to move away from C to a safer and modern language. I do not see the benefit in learning C++ for now.

#### Notes

This is a nice little project I might have a use for in my daily work. Thanks Brad for inspiring me to do something like this :)
